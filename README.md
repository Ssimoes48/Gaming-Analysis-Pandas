Panda's Gaming Analysis of Fantasy game 'Heroes of Pymoli'

The below analysis explores player data from an Independent Gaming companies most recent fantasy game: ‘Heroes of Pymoli’. Like many other games in the Fantasy genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. 
Using `Pandas`, I have evaluated the players purchasing habits by gender and by age to draw conclusions as to the most likely player category to spend money in the game. I also reviewed the most popular and profitable items sold.
